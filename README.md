# YouTube Automation with PyAutoGUI

This is a small Python automation script that can open and run any YouTube video automatically.  
It‚Äôs a learning project where I explored how to use the **[pyautogui](https://pyautogui.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)** library to control the mouse and keyboard for automation.

## üìå About the Project

I have been learning **AI Agents** and experimenting with **LangGraph** for automating workflows.  
Before jumping into complex AI workflows, I wanted to try something simple with Python automation.  

That‚Äôs where **pyautogui** comes in.  
- It can move the mouse, click, type, and press keyboard keys programmatically.  
- This script uses it to open a YouTube link and make sure the video starts playing.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Features
- Opens any YouTube URL you provide.  
- Waits for the browser to load.  
- Starts the video automatically using keystrokes.  
- Adds delays (`time.sleep`) to sync actions with the browser load time.
